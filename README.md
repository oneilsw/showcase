# Showcase

This application allows users to view information on a certain event, purchase tickets for said event, recieve a reciept of purchase through email, and the ability to contact the organizer. Inspiration is taken from [Roots Picnic](http://rootspicnic.com/philly/)

My idea is to go with it being a single page application, with modals for the ticket purchasing and contacting. Havent decided if i want a login.

# Things to Be taken care of:
* Hash routes for the NavBar
* Modal for ticket purchasing
* Artist banner is to be flier with all the performers names on it
* Contact Us on the bottom of the page
* A countdown clock for the specified day

If you have any ideas on how to improve on this application, please contact me at oneilswilliams@gmail.com

## Languages and Framework
**Front End**
